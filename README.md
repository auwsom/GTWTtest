# GitTheWorldTogether (GTWT)

A brief outline:
* Any problem or idea can be submitted as an GitHub Issue
   * Issues are submitted as a single problem or idea within a Catagory 
* Categories are created by anyone as a separate Repo and entered as an Issue in the main GTWT Repo
   * This GTWT Repo is the root Repo and contains only Category Repos and Issues specifically about GTWT
* Each Issue can be voted on by clicking the Thumbs Up reaction (click on the Smiley Face)
* All Issues within a Category can be sorted by Thumbs Up reactions to see the most popular or important
* Issues can be linked across Categories using GitHub labels (and using WikiData topics to help organize them)

All are welcome. Keep atmosphere fun. Family friendly language.

Here are the [GTWT Issues sorted by most Thumbs Ups](https://github.com/auwsom/GitTheWorldTogether/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+):
