# GitTheWorldTogether

Here's brief outline:
* coding collective of contibutors
* project ideas are submitted and voted on Reddit or another vote-enabled site
* live chat and discussion over Gitter or other sites, possibly using SecondLife proximity voices
* attribution and credit based on code contributions on GitHub and idea formation in Reddit

All are welcome, keep things fun.
